CENGden is a web-based e-marketplace designed exclusively for the Middle East Technical University (METU) Department of Computer Engineering (CENG) community. This platform enables students and faculty members to buy, sell, or share items within a trusted community.

I used Python for programming language for ease of usage. I used DjangoRest for building API's and Djongo for make this project suitable with MongoDB also used some PyMongo features for robust. 
I handled my mostly database operations with VsCode extension for MongoDB. You can reach my login/register/logout pages from my home page. I tried to uae ready templates but for free ones I could not find them suitable for my page.
